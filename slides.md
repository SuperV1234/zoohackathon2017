# SmartAlert

> **Automatic alert dispatching and tracking system**

---

Alerts dispatched to rangers **fighting against poachers**  require constant human monitoring and intervention.

* An operations room must be **manned 24/7**;
* Operators need to **manually** relay informations to rangers

<br>

### Most protected areas do not have enough resources for a human-driven system.
